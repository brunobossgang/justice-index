## When Someone Responds

### Academic responds positively
1. Thank them immediately
2. Ask specific questions (don't dump everything)
3. Ask if you can mention their feedback ("reviewed by researchers at Harvard Law")
4. Implement any methodological suggestions quickly
5. Update the site, then email journalists with the social proof

### Journalist responds
1. Respond within hours — they're on deadline
2. Offer: a call, additional data cuts, custom analysis for their angle
3. Have a one-paragraph bio ready
4. Don't try to control the story — just be helpful and available

### Advocate responds
1. Offer a walkthrough call
2. Ask what data/features would be most useful for their work
3. Be ready to generate custom district reports, charts, or data exports
4. This could lead to longer-term relationships — be responsive

## Email Tips

- **Send time:** Tuesday–Thursday, 9–11 AM Eastern (US)
- **Subject lines:** Lead with data or curiosity, not your name
- **Length:** Shorter is better. Nobody reads long cold emails.
- **Personalization:** Reference THEIR specific work, not just their org
- **Signature:** Keep it simple — name, location, link to site
- **Don't attach files** — link to the live site instead
