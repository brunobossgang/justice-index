**Contact:** cyang@law.harvard.edu *(public faculty page: hls.harvard.edu/faculty/crystal-s-yang/)*
**Title:** Bennett Boskey Professor of Law; Co-director, NBER Crime Working Group

**Subject:** Federal sentencing disparity data — would value your feedback

---

Dear Professor Yang,

I'm Bruno Beckman, a student in Stockholm who built an open-source dashboard analyzing racial, gender, and geographic disparities in federal sentencing using 388,334 USSC cases (FY2019–2024).

Your work on racial disparities and inter-judge variation in federal sentencing directly inspired this project. Our regression analysis finds Black defendants receive **+4.3 extra months** after controlling for offense level, criminal history, mandatory minimums, district, and departure status (R²=0.74) — consistent with your published findings.

I'd be grateful for any feedback on our methodology or framing. The tool includes a personal sentence calculator, district-level comparisons, and trend analysis — all open-source.

Thank you for your time.

## 2. Sonja Starr — University of Chicago Law School

**Contact:** sstarr@uchicago.edu *(public faculty page: law.uchicago.edu/faculty/starr)*
**Title:** Professor of Law (formerly Henry M. Butzel Professor, Michigan)

**Subject:** Gender & race in federal sentencing — interactive tool using USSC data

---

Dear Professor Starr,

I'm Bruno Beckman, a student in Stockholm. I built an open-source tool analyzing 388,334 federal sentencing cases (FY2019–2024) from the US Sentencing Commission.

Your foundational research on gender disparities in federal sentencing — particularly the finding that men receive substantially longer sentences than women for comparable offenses — was a key reference for this project. Our model controls for offense level, criminal history, mandatory minimums, and departure status, and we surface both racial and gender gaps interactively.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback on our statistical approach or how we present the gender disparity findings. The tool is designed to make this research accessible to non-academics.

Thank you for considering.

Best regards,

**Subject:** Prosecutorial discretion & race — open-source federal sentencing tool

---

Dear Professor Kutateladze,

I'm Bruno Beckman, a student in Stockholm. I've built an open-source dashboard analyzing racial, gender, and geographic disparities in 388,334 federal sentencing cases (FY2019–2024).

Your research on how race affects prosecutorial discretion — from charging decisions through plea bargaining — was formative for this project. While our data captures sentencing outcomes rather than prosecutorial decisions directly, the disparities we find (Black defendants receive +4.3 extra months after controls, R²=0.74) likely reflect some of the upstream effects your work documents.

I'd welcome any thoughts on our methodology or how we might better contextualize the role of prosecutorial discretion in our findings.
