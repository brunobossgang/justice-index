**Alt:** @SentencingProj on Twitter/X

**Subject:** Free open-source tool for sentencing disparity research & advocacy

Dear Sentencing Project team,

I'm Bruno Beckman, a student in Stockholm. I built a free, open-source dashboard analyzing racial, gender, and geographic disparities in 388,334 federal sentencing cases (FY2019–2024, USSC data).

Key finding: Black defendants receive +4.3 extra months after controlling for offense level, criminal history, mandatory minimums, and departure status (R²=0.74).

The tool is designed for organizations like yours to use freely — for reports, testimony, advocacy materials, or public education. It includes:
- District-level disparity lookup (compare any federal district)
- Trend analysis (FY2019–2024)
- Personal sentence calculator for public engagement
- Downloadable data and open-source code

Dear FAMM team,

I built a free, open-source tool analyzing 388,334 federal sentencing cases (FY2019–2024) from the US Sentencing Commission. It shows how race, gender, and geography affect sentence length after controlling for all legal factors.

Key stat: Black defendants receive +4.3 extra months even after full controls.

The tool includes a personal sentence calculator that makes these disparities tangible for the public — powerful for advocacy and storytelling. It's free, open-source, and based entirely on public government data.

Dear Vera team,

## Notes

- Send these **after** academics and journalists (week 3 of outreach)
- Frame as: "free tool for your work" — not "please promote my project"
- For large orgs (ACLU, EJI), expect slower response times
- If no response in 14 days, one follow-up
