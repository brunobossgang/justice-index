**Subject:** Federal sentencing racial gap is widening — new data on 388K cases

Hi [Name],

I've been following your reporting on sentencing disparities and wanted to share something I think you'll find significant.

I built Justice Index, an open analysis of 388,334 federal criminal cases from FY2019–2024 using US Sentencing Commission data. The headline finding isn't that racial disparities exist — your reporting and the USSC's own studies have established that. What's new is that **they're getting worse**.

A few numbers that jumped out:

- Black defendants receive **~4–5 extra months** after controlling for offense severity, criminal history, guidelines, and departure status — and the gap has widened year over year
- In drug trafficking specifically, the racial sentencing gap has **tripled since 2019**
- Black defendants are **25% less likely** to receive below-guideline sentences

The full methodology and interactive dashboard are at [justiceindex.org](https://justiceindex.org). Everything is transparent — regression specs, data sources, code.

**Would you be open to looking at the data?** Happy to walk through the methodology or share the dataset directly.

Best,
Bruno Beckman

## 2. Data Journalism Outlets (FiveThirtyEight / The Pudding / etc.)

**Subject:** Interactive dashboard: What 388K federal cases reveal about who gets punished

Hi [Name],

I built something I think fits squarely in your wheelhouse: an interactive dashboard exploring racial and geographic disparities across 388,334 US federal criminal sentences (FY2019–2024).

The data tells a few striking stories:

- **The geographic lottery:** Depending on which federal district handles your case, expected sentences for the same crime vary by ~100 months. Same offense, same history, wildly different outcomes.
- **A gap that's growing:** Black defendants get 4–5 extra months after controlling for everything measurable — and in drug trafficking, that gap has **tripled since 2019**.
- **Below-guideline sentences** go disproportionately to white defendants (Black defendants are 25% less likely to receive one).

The dashboard at [justiceindex.org](https://justiceindex.org) lets users explore by district, offense type, and year. All built on public USSC data with transparent methodology.

**Would this be a good fit for a story or visual feature?** Happy to share the full dataset and walk through the approach.

Best,

## 3. Academic / Policy Contacts

**Subject:** New regression analysis of federal sentencing disparities (N=388K, FY2019–2024)

Hi [Name],

I wanted to flag a project that extends the sentencing disparity literature in a direction I haven't seen well-covered: **temporal trends**.

Justice Index applies OLS regression to 388,334 individual federal cases from the US Sentencing Commission (FY2019–2024), controlling for primary offense, criminal history category, guideline range, departure status, and district. Building on the framework from Mustard (2001) and the USSC's own demographic reports, the key contributions are:

- **The disparity is worsening:** The Black-white sentencing gap (~4–5 months, all else equal) has increased over the study period
- **Offense-specific divergence:** In drug trafficking, the racial gap **tripled** between 2019 and 2024
- **Departure disparities:** Black defendants are ~25% less likely to receive below-guideline sentences

Full methodology, regression specifications, and the interactive dashboard are at [justiceindex.org](https://justiceindex.org).

**I'd value your feedback on the methodology** — and would welcome any suggestions for strengthening the analysis or connecting it to policy channels.

Best,
Bruno Beckman
