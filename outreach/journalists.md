**Subject:** 388K federal cases show Black defendants get 4+ extra months — interactive tool

---

Hi,

Black defendants in federal court receive 4.3 extra months in prison after controlling for offense severity, criminal history, mandatory minimums, and every other legal factor in the data. That's from 388,334 cases, FY2019–2024, all public US Sentencing Commission data.

I built an open-source interactive dashboard that lets anyone explore these disparities by race, gender, district, and time — including a personal calculator ("What Would Your Sentence Be?") that makes the data visceral.

This isn't advocacy — it's government data, made accessible.

**Subject:** Open-source tool: racial disparities in 388K federal sentencing cases

---

Hi,

I built an open-source tool analyzing all 388,334 federal sentencing cases from FY2019–2024 (USSC data). Key finding: Black defendants receive +4.3 extra months after full controls (R²=0.74).

The site includes a personal sentence calculator that lets users input their demographics and see predicted disparities — a "ProPublica COMPAS" moment but for sentencing data itself.

Everything is open-source, reproducible, built on public government data.

**Subject:** Data tool: what your federal sentence would be, based on 388K cases

---

Hi German,

Quick pitch: I built an interactive tool where anyone can enter their demographics and see what their federal sentence would look like — based on regression analysis of 388,334 real USSC cases (FY2019–2024).

The headline finding: Black defendants get 4.3 extra months after controlling for every legal factor in the data. But the personal calculator is the hook — it makes abstract disparity data feel personal.

Open-source, public government data, fully reproducible.
