I analyzed 388,334 federal criminal cases from the last 6 years.

After controlling for crime, criminal history, age, sex, and more — being Black adds 4-5 extra months to your sentence.

And it's getting worse. A thread 🧵

In 2019, the racial penalty was ~3.5 months.

By 2024, it grew to ~5 months.

The system isn't healing. It's deteriorating — while we debate whether the problem even exists.

Drug trafficking is the worst. The racial sentencing gap TRIPLED between 2019 and 2024.

The war on drugs never ended. It just stopped making headlines.

Black defendants are 25% less likely to get a below-guideline sentence.

Same crime. Same history. Same guidelines. Less mercy.

This gap has been rock-steady for 6 years straight.

Where you're sentenced matters as much as what you did.

~100 MONTH spread between the harshest and most lenient federal districts for the same crime.

That's 8+ years based on geography.

Assault: +20 months if you're Black
Robbery: +11 months
Drug trafficking: tripling gap

But sex offenses flip — Black defendants get shorter sentences there. The data is complicated. Honesty requires saying so.

Exercise your right to trial? The racial gap gets WORSE.

The penalty for going to trial falls harder on Black defendants than white defendants.

Your constitutional rights come with an unequal price tag.

Oh and women get 8-10 fewer months than men, all else equal.

That's actually a bigger gap than race.

A Black man faces both penalties stacked. A white woman benefits from both.

This is 388,334 real people. Real families. Real months lost.

I built justiceindex.org to make this data open and searchable. Every case. Every district. Every year.

Because you can't fix what you refuse to measure.
